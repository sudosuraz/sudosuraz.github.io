# How to install unsigned iOS apps

## Pre-requisites
1. PC or laptop (Linux/Windows)
2. Jailbroken iOS Device (required)
3. Filza inatalled (optional)
4. terminal app in iOS device

### Step 1
In the pc, I have unc0ver IPA file, which I am gonna install in jailbreak iOS device, first, run this command to transfer IPA file as zip file into iOS device with SCP command.

### Step 2
Now, take the root shell of the iOS device using the SSH.

## Step 4
Open the directory where we copied the unsigned IPA file as zip file and use the unzip command to unzip.

Here, after the unzip is done, we can find a new folder named **Payload**, inside that, we can see the **unc0ver.app** folder.

## Step 5
Now open the filza and open the same file location, and copy the **unc0ver.app** to **/Application** directory.

## Step 6
Now, open the terminal app in iOS device and run this command:
```@bash
uicache -a
```
Now you'll be able to see the app icon on home screen!
